                <br> Planning We will be planning at the next HOA Board meeting at Carrie Busey Elementary on Monday, November
                14th at 8pm. If you'd like to help out in any capacity of the planning please attend.
                <br>
                <br> Treat Tables - If you'd like to host, please e-mail
                <a href="mailto:board@prairiefieldshoa.com">board@prairiefieldshoa.com</a>. We will be looking for folks to provide and monitor the treat tables/voting
                stations. Each table will be given $30 to purchase the treats. We would like to focus on having these tables
                stationed at corners throughout the neighborhood to make it easy for visitors to find. This year we are looking
                to have ballot style voting sheets that people can carry with them as they look at the houses.
                <br>
                <br> PRIZES! As was the case last year, there will be trophies for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place as well as honorable
                mention ribbons. We will also have a fun prize for one random participating house!</p>
