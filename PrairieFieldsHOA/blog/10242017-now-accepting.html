                If you are interested in running for a seat on the PF HOA Board of Directors, you can download an application form
                <a href="../CovenantFiles/pf-hoa-2018-bod-nomination.pdf">here</a>.
                <br>
                <br> The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help
                from many other committee volunteers. The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible
                for using the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which are of value to
                Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the value of the neighborhood. If you have 1-2 hours a month
                to donate to the neighborhood, you are encouraged to run one of the 3 upcoming vacancies on the Board for
                a term which begins January 1, 2018 and runs through December 31, 2019. Applications must be submitted by
                November 10.
                <br>
                <br> This year, voting will be conducted electronically. You can opt for paper ballots by dropping a note in
                the HOA dropbox. Homeowners must be a member in good standing to vote in the election, and not owe the association
                more than $10. You can access the past due list by clicking here.
